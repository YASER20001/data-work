According to founders William Miller and Stephen Rollnick, “Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a person-centered counseling method for addressing the common problem of ambivalence about change.”1MI is a conversational style of interviewing used in counselling to address the ambivalence that clients often experience when faced with the need to change. Collaborative, person-centred and goal-oriented, MI aims to strengthen the client’s motivation toward healthy behaviour change.1 MI’s roots go back to the humanistic psychology of Carl Rogers,2 whose client-centred counselling emphasized reflective listening based on unconditional regard and accurate empathy. MI emerged in the 1980s in reaction to conventional treatment approaches that saw people with addiction problems as being in denial, unwilling to take responsibility and needing to be confronted to accept abstinence-based addiction treatment. Miller observed that people with addictions behave in ways that are surprisingly similar to other people with health challenges who commonly have mixed feelings about the need for change, as well as their ability to enact change.3 Miller and his colleagues noted that the ways counsellors interact with clients can have powerful effects on how the client’s ambivalence is resolved.1,4 Pressuring an ambivalent person to accept change often results in pushback. Rollnick, Miller and Butler refer to the urge to correct the client and prescribe solutions as the righting reflex, a problematic response, but also a valuable signal.5 They advise counsellors to respond by following the mnemonic RULE:  Recognize and resist the righting reflex; focus instead on  Understanding the client by  Listening reflectively to  Empower the client to explore change. Rather than wrestling with a person about the need to change, MI avoids confronting and opposing the client by aligning with him or her in a collaborative partnership to co-develop practical goals for change.

What Does the Evidence Say? Miller worked initially with problem drinkers with mild to moderate drinking problems, observing that MI helped clients move from ambivalence to becoming mobilized to try change. The initial focus was on preparing people for change. Once prepared, a more practical, skills-based treatment such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) would take over with the concrete task of behaviour change.3 But since Miller’s research was released in the early 1980s, MI has emerged as a therapy with efficacy The Essentials of…. is a series that offers evidence-based guidance and practical information to enhance practice in the substance use field.

MI, with its focus on how to engage and work with ambivalent clients, is now recognized and used in the treatment of a wide range of populations with mental and physical health problems and in the broad domain of health behaviour change, in both individual and group therapy formats.5,8,9 Ambivalence is not a unique problem of people with addictions, but a common problem with people facing the need to give up old behaviours and take up new ones. Being able to work more skillfully with ambivalent clients improves engagement, retention and therapy outcome. How Does It Work? Building on the reflective listening skills of Rogerian client-centred therapy, the MI approach adds an active, more intentional dimension to the counsellor’s role to guide the client towards healthy change. Rather than just following the client or directing and pushing for change, MI opens up a middle way, called guiding.1 MI replaces notions of denial and resistance toward change (traditionally used to blame the client for treatment avoidance and failure) with the concept of ambivalence to change. MI takes the compassionate view that people faced with the need to make significant behavioural change often feel stuck. In fact, people stuck in addictive behaviours often see clearly the pros and cons of both staying the same and changing to new behaviours. The counsellor works to engage the client and focus on understanding the client’s dilemma about change options. Even when the client admits to the importance of change, the client might lack confidence or knowledge about how to change. As the client talks and the counsellor listens reflectively, the counsellor guides the conversation towards the practical goals the client wants to work on, the reasons for doing so and the plan of action that will help the client get to where he or she wants to be.

As the client talks and the counsellor listens reflectively, the counsellor guides the conversation towards the practical goals the client wants to work on, the reasons for doing so and the plan of action that will help the client get to where he or she wants to be. Not only does research support the efficacy of MI in addictions treatment,7,10 it also suggests how it works. Moyers and colleagues found that talk consistent with MI led to clients talking more about change (self-motivational statements), whereas talk inconsistent with MI (directing, advising, confronting and warning) led to more talk by clients about sustaining behaviour (statements in favour of the status quo).11 Gaume and colleagues found that MI-consistent skills were linked with better recovery outcomes.12 This finding suggests that MI-consistent behaviour based on reflective listening leads to enhanced talk of change by the client, which results in better outcomes in treatment. While most well-developed therapies for addiction or other behavioural problems do equally well, clients with therapists who measure higher in empathy have better therapy outcomes than those with therapists lower in empathy, regardless of the method of therapy they use.13,14 MI is a communication style that aims to make an empathic connection with the client and build on that to work collaboratively for change. What is MI Spirit? The heart of MI is empathy and MI spirit manifests empathy in the counselling relationship in four ways:1  Partnership: the counsellor joins with the client to work collaboratively on change goals;  Acceptance: accepting the client as he or she is, the counsellor affirms the client’s autonomy and need to make his or her own decisions;  Compassion: the counsellor holds nothing higher than the client’s well-being, working to understand what that means from the client’s perspective; and  Evocation: rather than seeing the client as in need of instruction and direction, the counsellor evokes from the client what the client’s goals are and how he or she wants to be helped."

The skills appear to be simple, but grounding the counselling process in them is not easy. It takes practice, feedback and commitment. In practice, the MI counsellor has three key tasks:15 1. To listen reflectively; 2. To elicit client change talk; and 3. To offer information, feedback and advice using the MI style. Task One: Listen Reflectively Of the five core skills in MI, four are used to listen reflectively. They can be remembered by the mnemonic OARS:  Open questions  Affirmations  Reflections  Summaries Open questions seek to get the client to say more, unlike closed questions that can be answered “yes” or “no.” A goal in MI counselling is for the client to speak at least half the time. Open questions invite the client to elaborate, and show that the counsellor is interested in listening to and understanding the client. Affirmations are how the counsellor using MI takes an active curiosity in interacting with the client. Providing affirmations is unlike unfocused cheerleading or, even worse, treating the client suspiciously. Where there are things about the client’s values and behaviours that can be credited, the MI counsellor seeks to do that. Such affirmations can be as simple as acknowledging that the client made the effort to come to the appointment or recognizing the client’s willingness to persist in seeking healthy change, especially if the client has experienced slips and relapses in the past. Reflections are statements, not questions. They are based on what the counsellor observes in interacting with the client. Simple reflections stay on the surface, mirroring or paraphrasing what the client is saying, always in a tentative way that seeks to check with the client that you are understanding as you listen actively. Complex reflections go beneath the surface in a variety of ways, such as reflecting what the counsellor thinks the client might be thinking or feeling, even if not"

Complex reflections go beneath the surface in a variety of ways, such as reflecting what the counsellor thinks the client might be thinking or feeling, even if not stated explicitly. A reflection might also note the client’s ambivalence about change: on the one hand, you want a better life; on the other hand, you are not confident you can give up old behaviours. The skillful MI counsellor is able to intentionally choose the reflective response made to the client. The evidence suggests that when the counsellor makes more reflections than asks questions, and more complex reflections than simple ones, the more effective the counselling and the stronger the empathic connection.1 Summaries allow the counsellor to draw on his or her active listening by pulling together key points in what the client says and offering it back to the client for confirmation and comment. Summaries are ways of keeping track of what is important for the client, wrapping up one part of the conversation and shifting to another, and ending an interaction by highlighting important points in the conversation. They are an important way the counsellor can guide the counselling process so that the client feels understood and the process is guided towards change. Learning MI can be thought of as becoming progressively skillful at reflective listening, starting with moving from asking closed questions to using open questions. Building on open questions, the MI counsellor learns to make reflections, first, ones that are simple, and then those that are complex. Affirmations are a particular kind of reflection: statements that aim to recognize and acknowledge"

Summaries allow the counsellor ways of organizing and giving feedback to the client about what has been talked about in ways that can be powerfully effective in shaping movement towards change. Together, these four skills form the skillset the counsellor relies on to build an empathic connection with the client, leading to a compassionate understanding of the client and setting the stage for eliciting talk of change in the client. Task Two: Elicit Change Talk In using the MI skills, the counsellor actively pays attention to what is happening with the client. Is the client speaking more? What is the client saying? Is it talk in favour of change or talk about the status quo? Change talk is client speech in favour of healthy behavioural change. Sustain talk is client talk against change and in favour of leaving things alone. Change talk comes in two forms: talk in preparation of change and talk about change that is already happening. Altogether there are seven types of change talk, remembered by the mnemonic DARN CATs.1 DARN describes preparatory change talk, which occurs whenever the client speaks about:  Desire to change: “I want to get better; I hope I can do this”;  Ability to change: “I’ve been able to stop at times in the past; I’m able to do this”;  Reasons for change: “If I can do this, my health will improve; I don’t want to lose my job”; and  Need to change: “I can’t stand living like this; I need to stay out of jail.” CATs describes talk of active change, which occurs whenever the client speaks about:  Commitment: “I am going to get help for this problem”;  Actions: “I have talked to my boss about needing time off to get help”; and  Taking steps: “I’ve started cutting back on my drug use to make it easier later to stop.” Task Three: Offering Advice and Sharing"

When done in MI style, it is used to give feedback to the client, when requested, that draws on the counsellor’s knowledge, expertise and experience. Providing information and advice are important parts of the helping process. In MI, the counsellor works to get the client to ask for advice rather than foisting it upon them. Offering advice is always preceded by asking the client’s permission to share feedback with the client, as well as inviting the client to give his or her ideas and thoughts first. When giving advice or information to the client, MI emphasizes the importance of sharing it in small chunks, stopping to ask the client what he or she is hearing and what it means for them. This process has various descriptions including Check — Chunk — Check, and Elicit — Provide — Elicit. That is, Check (for permission), then Chunk (offer a short bit of advice or information), and then Check (for feedback and if it is ok to go on); or Elicit (permission), then Provide (advice, information), then Elicit (feedback and permission to proceed). MI shifts the focus of giving advice, information and feedback to include not just what the counsellor says, but also what the client hears, what it means to the client and what it inclines the client to want to do. The measure of how I am doing as a counsellor is not so much what I think, say and do, but the effect it has on the client. In earlier years, MI keyed on OARS skills and reflective listening, perhaps underplaying the important role of information, feedback and advice in counselling. More recently the value of sharing"

    "text": "Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction • Centre canadien sur les dépendances et l’usage de substances Page 5 Motivational Interviewing The Four Processes of MI: Engaging, Focusing, Evoking and Planning Miller and Rollnick observe that counsellors are often in a hurry to take action.1 However, the evidence suggests that if the client is not really engaged, if there is no shared sense of focus, and the client’s motives and goals are not clearly understood, action will be ineffective. Before moving to action planning, the MI counsellor ensures that the client feels connected and understood, which does not need to take a long time. In brief interventions, it can occur in one session. With clients who have more chronic and extended problems, it will likely need more time, and is crucial in building ongoing care and support. MI sees counsellor engagement with the client as a necessary process to be maintained through all the phases of care. By connecting with the client, counsellor and client can both develop an effective understanding of one another, allowing them to collaboratively focus on goals and evoke reasons for change. That collaboration sets the stage for the final step: planning for change and setting a change agenda.1,16 By drawing attention to the importance of engaging the client, focusing on goals and evoking reasons for change, the counsellor using MI skills builds a foundation for plans and actions that are more likely to be effective because the client is committed to them. One guiding metaphor in MI is that counselling is about dancing, rather than wrestling, with the client. MI counselling is about building rapport. By using the MI skills, the counsellor nurtures the empathic connection that is at the heart of MI practice. MI practice brings skills and spirit together. The skills can be learned and sharpened. Spirit provides the compass points that guide the counsellor in the challenging situations he or she will experience in counselling.

Miller and Rollnick suggest that having skills without spirit is like reading the words of a song without playing the music.1 Spirit without skills is like feeling moved to play the music without having an instrument to perform it on. Skills and spirit working in concert is what makes counselling effective. Implications for Substance Use and Allied Professionals Clinical research has repeatedly found that the methods and techniques that counsellors use in their work might not be as important in affecting clinical outcome as their ability to make empathic connections with their clients.17,18,19 Studies have repeatedly shown that well-conceived and well- supervised interventions by well-trained counsellors usually have comparable efficacy and produce good outcomes. What makes a bigger difference than the method of treatment is the empathic abilities of the counsellor. Clients of counsellors demonstrating higher levels of empathy have been shown to have better outcomes that those of counsellors with lower empathy. Being empathic is an evidence-based practice that has dramatic implications in the recruitment and training of counsellors in addiction and allied health domains.13 MI started as an effective way of working with problem drinkers who had mixed feelings about changing their behaviour. Decades later it is now recognized as an evidence-based practice in the treatment of substance use problems and other addictive behaviours, and as an effective way of helping people who are ambivalent about health behavioural change across many domains of mental and physical health. Its relevance today in clinical practice is increasingly supported by the clinical research literature and the growing number of counsellors who either make it a foundational part of their clinical work or have added to their clinical approach by making it MI-enhanced. It is also emerging as an element in the curriculum in the colleges and universities that train healthcare and social service professionals, including psychologist, social workers, psychiatrists, family doctors, nurses, pharmacists and addiction workers across Canada."

MI is described by its practitioners as a style of counselling and a way of being with clients.20 Practicing MI requires more than knowing about MI. It requires knowledge and that comes from practice. Workshops and readings offer energizing starting points. Moving from novice to expert is a gradual practice. One of the heartening things about MI is that most people recognize MI spirit and are already familiar with some of the skills described above. MI training is about becoming better at connecting with clients and helping them succeed at making healthy changes. The practice of improving clinical skills is a continuing one. The Motivational Interviewing Network of Trainers (MINT) is an international body that offers training for practitioners who want to be recognized as MI trainers. Trainers with good standing in MINT have access to emerging knowledge and approaches in MI and to approved training materials and tools. MINT is developing policies and protocols for more formal certification of MI practitioners and trainers. Learning MI is a matter of practice. Miller and colleagues offer these suggestions for starters:13  Listen actively before jumping in with questions;  If you find you have asked three questions in a row, use one of the other OARS skills;  Try to make at least half your questions be open ones, rather than closed; and  Aim to offer two reflections for each question. In MI, the focus is on what the client is saying and helping the client decide what he or she will do next. MI counsellors work to give the client the good lines.

Resist the righting reflex.\n• The “righting reflex” is when the practitioner desires to fix what seems wrong with people and \npromptly set them on a better cours e.\n• It is an example of a \"directing\" communication s tyle.\n• People who are ambivalent about change do not find motivation from the righting reflex.\n2. Embrace the use of “competence worldview” rather than “deficit worldview.”\n• Competence Worldview: People are competent, and they possess the self-knowledge, \nattitudes, and capabilities to effect change in their own lives.\n• Deficit Worldview: People experiencing difficulties or who are unwell most likely do not have the \nresources, skills, or characteristics to effect change on their own.\n3.

MI is a collaboration between experts.\n• People are the experts of their own lives\n• MI is not done “to” or “on” someone, but “for” and “with” a person\n• You must let go of the expert role while maintaining an awareness of the aspirations and\nc\nonvictions you bring to the conversation\nAcceptance. We should express an attitude of unconditional positive regard. \n• Absolute worth\n• Accurate empathy\n• Autonomy support\n• Affirmation\nCompassion. We conduct MI in the service of others. \n• Deliberately promote the welfare of another\n• Get ourselves out of the way\n• Serve as a benevolent witness\n• Distinguish between the communication style of MI vs. that of a “used car salesman”\nEvocation. Motivation for change is not installed but is evoked. \n• Motivation for change already exists within people\n• Adopt the perspective that people truly have the wisdom and resources within themselves to\ndetermine and move towards their goals\n• People are more likely to change if they identify the reasons to do so themselves"

    "text": "attcnetwork.org/greatlakes 3 OARS: A Quick Guide OARS stands for open questions, affirmations, reflection, and summary. Open questions do the following: • E licit complex answers beyond “yes,” “no,” or other single word answers • A llow for endless response possibilities • Avoid asking “why?” to prevent others from feeling defensive about their responses Examples of open questions: Tell me about… What was that like? Tell me more about that Say more about [ x ]. How does that fit with your life/work? What was that experience like for you? Tell about how that fits into your routine. How does that compare with where you’re at? What would have to happen for you to make a change? Affirmations do the following: • Show appreciation for the other person’s experiences • Focus on “you” and avoid using “I” (e.g., I think…, I ’m proud…, I’m pleased…, etc. ) • Seek opportunities to notice and affirm past successes, future hopes, current efforts, struggles, resiliency, humanity, character, strengths, and personal values. Examples of affirmation openers: That took a lot of… This shows… You’re really… It must have taken a lot of work to… What about you would make this possible? You demonstrated [ x ] about yourself. Summaries do the following: • Combine the important aspects of what someone has said. This shows we are listening • Shine a light on what’s most important • P rovide another chance to reinforce change talk Types of Summaries : • Collecting summaries: list items discussed in the order they were spoken • Linking summaries: incorporate previously shared info with the current discussion • Transitional summaries: Wrap-up a topic or session by highlighting important details • Recapitulating summary: Include all the change talk gathered through evocation, and partner with the client to confirm everything has been included, ask for agreement, and end with an open question. Note: You should signify to the client you are going to provide a summary by saying something like: “I want to be sure I have this right…, ” “Let’s makes sure we’re on the same page…, ” “What you said is"

Simple Reflections: A reflection that simply repeats or rephrases what the person has said. Simple reflections are useful for clarifying what was said or to reflect back specific change talk. Complex Reflections: A style of reflection that is nuanced, affirming, and encourages change. Types of Complex Reflections: Paraphrase: A restatement which includes an educated guess or inference to add meaning to what the person said. Amplification: Use strategically to soften sustain talk by exaggerating, overstating, or increasing the intensity of the client’s statement—it must be said without sarcasm! Client: I’m not interested in quitting drinking at this time. Staff: There’s no way it makes sense to even consider it. Double-Sided: Contains both sides of ambivalence (cons/pros) are in a single reflection. You must end the reflection with the change talk to keep the emphasis on the change. Staff: On one hand, you don’t like the medication side effects; on the other hand, it has helped you achieve more stability in your life.

    "text": "1 Understanding Motivational Interviewing Summary Motivational Interviewing (MI) is often recommended as an evidence-based approach to behavior change. However, definitions of MI vary widely, including out of date and inaccurate understandings. This document provides a brief summary of what MI is, what is isn’t and where to go next if you are interested in learning more about this approach. What is Motivational Interviewing? “MI is a collaborative, goal-oriented style of communication with particular attention to the language of change. It is designed to strengthen personal motivation for and commitment to a specific goal by eliciting and exploring the person’s own reasons for change within an atmosphere of acceptance and compassion.” (Miller & Rollnick, 2013, p. 29) The most current version of MI is described in detail in Miller and Rollnick (2013) Motivational Interviewing: Helping people to change (3rd edition). Key qualities include: • MI is a guiding style of communication, that sits between following (good listening) and directing (giving information and advice). • MI is designed to empower people to change by drawing out their own meaning, importance and capacity for change. • MI is based on a respectful and curious way of being with people that facilitates the natural process of change and honors client autonomy. It is important to note that MI requires the clinician to engage with the client as an equal partner and refrain from unsolicited advice, confronting, instructing, directing, or warning. It is not a way to “get people to change” or a set of techniques to impose on the conversation. MI takes time, practice and requires self-awareness and discipline from the clinician. (Miller & Rollnick, 2009) While the principles and skills of MI are useful in a wide range of conversations, MI is particularly useful to help people examine their situation and options when any of the following are present: • Ambivalence is high and people are stuck in mixed feelings about change • Confidence is low and people doubt their abilities to change • Desire is low and people are uncertain about whether they want to make a change • Importance is low"

    "text": "2 Core elements of Motivational Interviewing • MI is practiced with an underlying spirit or way of being with people: o Partnership. MI is a collaborative process. The MI practitioner is an expert in helping people change; people are the experts of their own lives. o Evocation. People have within themselves resources and skills needed for change. MI draws out the person’s priorities, values, and wisdom to explore reasons for change and support success. o Acceptance. The MI practitioner takes a nonjudgmental stance, seeks to understand the person’s perspectives and experiences, expresses empathy, highlights strengths, and respects a person’s right to make informed choices about changing or not changing. o Compassion. The MI practitioner actively promotes and prioritizes clients’ welfare and wellbeing in a selfless manner. • MI has core skills of OARS, attending to the language of change and the artful exchange of information: o Open questions draw out and explore the person’s experiences, perspectives, and ideas. Evocative questions guide the client to reflect on how change may be meaningful or possible. Information is often offered within a structure of open questions (Elicit-Provide-Elicit) that first explores what the person already knows, then seeks permission to offer what the practitioner knows and then explores the person’s response. o Affirmation of strengths, efforts, and past successes help to build the person’s hope and confidence in their ability to change. o Reflections are based on careful listening and trying to understand what the person is saying, by repeating, rephrasing or offering a deeper guess about what the person is trying to communicate. This is a foundational skill of MI and how we express empathy. o Summarizing ensures shared understanding and reinforces key points made by the client. o Attending to the language of change identifies what is being said against change (sustain talk) and in favor of change (change talk) and, where appropriate, encouraging a movement away from sustain talk toward change talk. o Exchange of information respects that both the clinician and client have expertise. Sharing information is considered a two way street and needs to be responsive to what the"

Sharing information is considered a two way street and needs to be responsive to what the client is saying. • MI has four fundamental processes. These processes describe the “flow” of the conversation although we may move back and forth among processes as needed: o Engaging: This is the foundation of MI. The goal is to establish a productive working relationship through careful listening to understand and accurately reflect the person’s experience and perspective while affirming strengths and supporting autonomy. o Focusing: In this process an agenda is negotiated that draws on both the client and practitioner expertise to agree on a shared purpose, which gives the clinician permission to move into a directional conversation about change. o Evoking: In this process the clinician gently explores and helps the person to build their own “why” of change through eliciting the client’s ideas and motivations. Ambivalence is"

This process requires skillful attention to the person’s talk about change. o Planning: Planning explores the “how” of change where the MI practitioner supports the person to consolidate commitment to change and develop a plan based on the person’s own insights and expertise. This process is optional and may not be required, but if it is the timing and readiness of the client for planning is important. MI is framed as a method of communication rather than an intervention, sometimes used on its own or combined with other treatment approaches. There are a number of benefits of learning MI amongst other approaches to helping conversations: • MI has been applied across a broad range of settings (e.g. health, corrections, human services, education), populations (e.g. age, ethnicity, religion, sexuality and gender identities), languages, treatment format (e.g. individual, group, telemedicine) and presenting concerns (e.g. health, fitness, nutrition, risky sex, treatment adherence, medication adherence, substance use, mental health, illegal behaviors, gambling, parenting). • MI compares well to other evidence-based approaches in formal research studies. • MI is compatible with the values of many disciplines and evidence-based approaches. • Although the full framework is a complex skill set that require time and practice, the principles of MI have intuitive or “common sense” appeal and core elements of MI can be readily applied in practice as the clinician learns the approach. • MI has observable practice behaviors that allow clinicians to receive clear and objective feedback from a trainer, consultant or supervisor.

Tr auma: In this text, the term “trauma” refers to experiences that cause intense physical and psy chological stress reactions. It can refer to “a single event, multiple events, or a set of circumstances that is experienced by an individual as physically and emotionally harmful or threatening and that has lasting adverse effects on the individual’s physical, social, emotional, or spiritual well being” (SAMHSA, 2012, p. 2). Although many individuals report a single specific traumatic event, others, especially those seeking mental health or substance abuse services, have been ex posed to multiple or chronic traumatic events. See the “What Is Trauma” section in Part 1, Chap ter 1, for a more indepth definition and discussion of trauma. Tr auma-informed: A trauma-informed approach to the delivery of behavioral health services includes an understanding of trauma and an awareness of the impact it can have across settings, services, and populations. It involves viewing trauma through an ecological and cultural lens and recognizing that context plays a significant role in how individuals perceive and process traumatic events, whether acute or chronic. In May 2012, SAMHSA convened a group of national experts who identified three key elements of a trauma-informed approach: “(1) realizing the prevalence of trauma; (2) recognizing how trauma affects all individuals involved with the program, organi zation, or system, including its own workforce; and (3) responding by putting this knowledge into practice” (SAMHSA, 2012, p 4). Tr auma-informed care: TIC is a strengths-based service delivery approach “that is grounded in an understanding of and responsiveness to the impact of trauma, that emphasizes physical, psy chological, and emotional safety for both providers and survivors, and that creates opportunities for survivors to rebuild a sense of control and empowerment” (Hopper, Bassuk, & Olivet, 2010, p. 82). It also involves vigilance in anticipating and avoiding institutional processes and individual practices that are likely to retraumatize individuals who already have histories of trauma, and it upholds the importance of consumer participation in the"

Tr auma-specific treatment services: These services are evidence-based and promising practices that facilitate recovery from trauma. The term “trauma-specific services” refers to prevention, intervention, or treatment services that address traumatic stress as well as any co-occurring disor ders (including substance use and mental disorders) that developed during or after trauma. Trauma survivor: This phrase can refer to anyone who has experienced trauma or has had a traumatic stress reaction. Knowing that the use of language and words can set the tone for recov ery or contribute to further retraumatization, it is the intent of this manual to put forth a message of hope by avoiding the term “victim” and instead using the term “survivor” when appropriate. xix"

Avoid asking family members or friends of the client to serve as interpreters. • Elicit only the information necessary for determining a history of trauma and the possible existence and extent of traumatic stress symptoms and related disorders. There is no need to probe deeply into the details of a client’s traumatic experiences at this stage in the treatment process. Given the lack of a therapeutic relationship in which to process the information safely, pursuing details of trauma can cause re traumatization or produce a level of re sponse that neither you nor your client is prepared to handle. Even if a client wants to tell his or her trauma story, it’s your job to serve as “gatekeeper” and preserve the client’s safety. Your tone of voice when sug gesting postponement of a discussion of trauma is very important. Avoid conveying the message, “I really don’t want to hear about it.” Examples of appropriate state ments are: − “Your life experiences are very im portant, but at this early point in our work together, we should start with what’s going on in your life currently rather than discussing past experiences in detail. If you feel that certain past experiences are having a big effect on your life now, it would be helpful for us to discuss them as long as we focus on your safety and recovery right now.” − “Talking about your past at this point could arouse intense feelings—even more than you might be aware of right now. Later, if you choose to, you can talk with your counselor about how to work on exploring your past.” − “Often, people who have a history of trauma want to move quickly into the details of the trauma to gain relief. I understand this desire, but my concern for you at this moment is to help you establish a sense of safety and support before moving"

Traumas can evoke shame, guilt, anger, or other intense feelings that can make it difficult for the client to report them aloud to an interviewer. Clients are more likely to report trauma when they use self-administered screening tools; however, these types of screening instruments only guide the next step. Interviews should coin cide with self-administered tools to create a sense of safety for the client (someone is present as he or she completes the screen ing) and to follow up with more indepth data gathering after a self-administered screening is complete. The Trauma History Questionnaire (THQ) is a self- administered tool (Green, 1996). It has been used successfully with clinical and nonclinical populations, including med i cal patients, women who have exper i enced domestic violence, and people with serious mental illness (Hooper, Stockton, 97"

Even if you do not directly conduct therapy, knowledge of grounding can help you defuse an escalating situation or calm a client who is triggered by the assessment process. Grounding strategies help a person who is overwhelmed by memories or strong emotions or is dissociating ; they help the person become aware of the here and now. A useful metaphor is the experience of walking out of a movie theater. When the person dissociates or has a flashback, it’s like watching a mental movie; ground ing techniques help him or her step out of the movie theater into the daylight and the present envi ronment. The client’s task is not only to hold on to moments from the past, but also to acknowledge that what he or she was experiencing is from the past. Try the following techniques: 1. Ask the client to state what he or she observes. Guide the client through this exercise by using statements like, “You seem to feel very scared/angry right now. You’re probably feeling things related to what happened in the past. Now, you’re in a safe situation. Let’s try to stay in the present. Take a slow deep breath, relax your shoulders, put your feet on the floor; let’s talk about what day and time it is, notice what’s on the wall, etc. What else can you do to feel okay in your body right now?” 2. Help the client decrease the intensity of affect. • “Emotion dial”: A client imagines turning down the volume on his or her emotions. • Clenching fists can move the energy of an emotion into fists, which the client can then re lease. • Guided imagery can be used to visualize a safe place. • Distraction (see #3 below). • Use strengths-based questions (e.g., “How did you survive?” or “What strengths did you possess to survive the trauma?”). 3. Distract the client from unbearable emotional states. • Have"

Distract the client from unbearable emotional states. • Have the client focus on the external environment (e.g., name red objects in the room). • Ask the client to focus on recent and future events (e.g., “to do” list for the day). • Help the client use self-talk to remind himself or herself of current safety. • Use distractions, such as counting, to return the focus to current reality. • Somatosensory techniques (toe-wiggling, touching a chair) can remind clients of current reality. 4. Ask the client to use breathing techniques. • Ask the client to inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth. • Have the client place his or her hands on his or her abdomen and then watch the hands go up and down while the belly expands and contracts. Source: Melnick & Bassuk, 2000. Trauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services Krupnick, & Green, 2011). Screening in struments (including the THQ) are includ ed in Appendix D of this TIP . • Interview the client if he or she has trouble reading or writing or is otherwise unable to complete a checklist. Clients who are likely to minimize their trauma when using a checklist (e.g., those who exhibit significant symptoms of dissociation or repression) benefit from a clinical interview. A trained interviewer can elicit information that a self-administered checklist does not cap ture. Overall, using both a self-administered questionnaire and an interview can help achieve greater clarity and context. • Allow time for the client to become calm and oriented to the present if he or she has very intense emotional responses when recalling or acknowledging a trauma. At such times, avoid responding with such exclamations as “I don’t know how you survived that!” (Bernstein, 2000). If the client has difficul ty self-soothing, guide him or her"

    "text": "Part 1, Chapter 4— Screening and Assessment in terview when a client has dissociated or is experiencing intense feelings in response to screening and/or interview questions. • Avoid phrases that imply judgment about the trauma. For example, don’t say to a cli ent who survived Hurricane Katrina and lost family members, “It was God’s will,” or “It was her time to pass,” or “It was meant to be.” Do not make assumptions about what a person has experienced. Ra ther, listen supportively without imposing personal views on the client’s experience. • Provide feedback about the results of the screening. Keep in mind the client’s vulner ability, ability to access resources, strengths, and coping strategies. Present results in a synthesized manner, avoiding complicated, overly scientific jargon or explanations. Al low time to process client reactions during the feedback session. Answer client ques tions and concerns in a direct, honest, and compassionate manner. Failure to deliver feedback in this way can negatively affect clients’ psychological status and severely weaken the potential for developing a ther apeutic alliance with the client. • Be aware of the possible legal implications of assessment. Information you gather dur ing the screening and assessment process can necessitate mandatory reporting to au thorities, even when the client does not want such information disclosed (Najavits, 2004). For example, you can be required to report a client’s experience of child abuse even if it happened many years ago or the client doesn’t want the information report ed. Other legal issues can be quite com plex, such as confidentiality of records, pursuing a case against a trauma perpetra tor and divulging information to third par ties while still protecting the legal status of information used in prosecution, and child custody issues (Najavits, 2004). It’s essen tial that you know the laws in your State, have an expert legal consultant available, a nd access clinical supervision.

Barriers and Challenges to Trauma-Informed Screening and Assessment Barriers It is not necessarily easy or obvious to identify an individual who has survived trauma with out screening. Moreover, some clients may deny that they have encountered trauma and its effects even after being screened or asked direct questions aimed at identifying the oc currence of traumatic events. The two main barriers to the evaluation of trauma and its related disorders in behavioral health settings are clients not reporting trauma and providers overlooking trauma and its effects. Concerning the first main barrier, some events will be experienced as traumatic by one person but considered nontraumatic by another. A history of trauma encompasses not only the experience of a potentially traumatic event, but also the person’s responses to it and the mean ings he or she attaches to the event. Certain situations make it more likely that the client will not be forthcoming about traumatic events or his or her responses to those events. Some clients might not have ever thought of a particular event or their response to it as trau matic and thus might not report or even recall the event. Some clients might feel a reluctance to discuss something that they sense might bring up uncomfortable feelings (especially with a counselor whom they’ve only recently met). Clients may avoid openly discussing traumatic events or have difficulty recognizing or articulating their experience of trauma for other reasons, such as feelings of shame, guilt, or fear of retribution by others associated with the event (e.g., in cases of interpersonal or 99"
